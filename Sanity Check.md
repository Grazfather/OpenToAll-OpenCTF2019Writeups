# Sanity Check(10)
To complete the sanity check challenge, you must:

1. Intercept a request to challenges.openctf.cat:9005 using Burp Suite.
2. Edit that request so that, somewhere among the headers, there is `cat flag`.
3. Intercept the response, which contains the flag `flag{a5e78d3bfed23dd8b331b2617f8a5a5d63048d68}`, which is the solution for the first challenge
